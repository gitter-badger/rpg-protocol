# Purpose of this file

Before we start writing a formal protocol specification, I thought it would be a good idea to put some general notes into a document.

# Core RPG Elements

Here we can define a list of elements that we agree are important parts of an RPG.  They must be very important elements, things that without which would result in a system that is not an RPG.  An example of something that would NOT go in this list would be assets such as sound or graphics, as RPGs can be text based.
